1. Create the key and security group which allows the port 80.
2. Launch EC2 instance.
3. In this Ec2 instance use the key and security group which we have created in step 1.
4. Launch one Volume (EBS) and mount that volume into /var/www/html
5. The developer has uploaded the code into GitHub repo also the repo has some images.
6. Copy the GitHub repo code into /var/www/html
7. Create an S3 bucket, and copy/deploy the images from GitHub repo into the s3 bucket and change the permission to public readable.
